# KartApp-BE
## Description
This project is going to be a (rental) karting management application. Customers can make an account and log in to the site. They will then be able to book a session to go karting by choosing the timeslot and if desired a specific kart. Afterwards customers can view the karting session results they took part in and leave a review to voice their experience. Customers can also edit their profile to update their personal information. For the administration side the employee can manage customers, karts, booking, sessions and reviews. Employees can view the full list of registered customers and karts. Karts can be pulled out of rotation if they need to be fixed for example. Employees can also see all bookings made and which bookings are put in which sessions. This way its clear in what kart the customers are assigned to. If all of this is finished I can also try to add a payment system, but this isnâ€™t my priority. The aim of this project is to build a useful and practical application and learn more about programming, more specifically C# and React.
